MySQL 
Exercise 3 


1. Write a program containing a loop that iterates from 1 to 1000 using a variable I, which is incremented each time around the loop. The program should output the value of I every hundred iterations (i.e., the output should be 100, 200, etc.). 
 
create procedure abc()
begin
declare num int default 1;
while num<=1000 do
	if mod(num,100)=0 then
		insert into tempp values (num,'value');
	end if;
	set num=num+1;
end while;
end;//
 
 
 
 mysql> create procedure abc()
    -> begin
    -> declare num int default 1;
    -> while num<=1000 do
    ->  if mod(num,100)=0 then
    ->          insert into tempp values (num,'value');
    ->  end if;
    ->  set num=num+1;
    -> end while;
    -> end;//

2. Write a program that examines all the numbers from 1 to 999, displaying all those for which the sum of the cubes of the digits equal the number itself. 

create procedure abc()
begin
declare num1 int default 1;
DECLARE sum INT DEFAULT 0;
DECLARE temp INT;
DECLARE remainder INT;
DECLARE digits INT DEFAULT 3;
while num1<1000 do
    SET temp = num1;
    WHILE temp != 0 DO
        SET temp = FLOOR(temp / 10);
    END WHILE;
    SET temp = num1;
    WHILE temp != 0 DO
        SET remainder = MOD(temp, 10);
        SET sum = sum + POWER(remainder,3);
        SET temp = FLOOR(temp / 10);
    END WHILE;
	if sum=num1 then
		insert into tempp values(num1,'True');
	end if;
	
	set num1=num1+1;
end while;
end;//
	
 
 
 
3. Write a program that Selects from any table a minimum and maximum value for a radius, along with an increment factor, and generates a series of radii by repeatedly adding the increment to the minimum until the maximum is reached. For each value of the radius, compute and display the circumference, area, and volume of the sphere. (Be sure to include both the maximum and the minimum values.). 
 
 
 
 
4. A palindrome is a word that is spelled the same forward and backward, such as level, radar, etc. Write a program to Selects from any table a five letter word and determine whether it is a palindrome. 
 
 
 
 
 
5. Modify the above program to Select from any table a variable length word. This requires determining how many characters are read in.
